# Image Upscaler

## Overview

AI and JavaScript work together to help you enlarge your images without losing quality. You can use it on your phone or computer. A great tool to have on hand!

## Features

- **AI for image enhancement:** the app uses the esrgan-slim model to make images larger while maintaining their quality.
- **Scaling factor:** you can make your image 2x, 3x, or 4x larger.
- **Customizable download format:** you can download the upscaled image in "jpg" or "png" format.

Please note that there are some limitations on images that it can work with:
- Up to 5 MB
- Up to 1000px * 1000px (but not necessarily square)
- Only .jpg or .png format

The limitations are related to the work of models in the browser (to learn more, view the docs on the UpscalerJS website if you are interested).

## Usage

1. Upload an image.
2. Choose the scale you need — 2x, 3x, or 4x.
3. Click the "Upscale image" button.
4. Get your upscaled image! You can drag the slider left and right to see it before and after, and download the upscaled image in "jpg" or "png" format.
